    "The convolutional neural network that we developed and ran was adequate for use on a small problem with a few classes, but it lacks the explanatory power to produce highly accurate results for more difficult datasets.  Instead, more interesting neural networks have been developed which have greater explanatory power.  One of the most powerful architectures today is called ResNet, which is short for residual network.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, you could take the network that you've been working on and make it more flexible by adding more convolutional layers, which is to say that we could add more sequences of feature map generation.  This is what is meant when people use the term \"deep\" learning.  However, if you did this, you would quickly run into the problem that your network would struggle to learn weights in the lower (closer to the inputs) layers of the network.  This is a result of the way that neural networks are trained.  In particular they rely on the ability to take the derivative of a misfit function (e.g. least squares) with respect to a parameter, and to adjust the weight based on that derivative.  However in (naive) deep networks, this gradient has the tendency to become negligibly small as the impact of that weight gets lost in the myriad layers of convolutions and activations closer to the output.  \n",

The pedantic amongst us will note that this only works when the output of $\\mathcal{F}_{l}(\\mathbf{x}_l)$ is the same size as the input.
